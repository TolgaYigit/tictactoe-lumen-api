# Tic Tac Toe Lumen API

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Make sure your server meets the following requirements:

```
PHP >= 5.6.4
OpenSSL PHP Extension
PDO PHP Extension
Mbstring PHP Extension
```

### Installing

First, clone the repo:
```
$ git clone git@github.com:TolgaYigit/tictactoe-lumen-api.git
```
#### Install dependencies
```
$ cd tictactoe-lumen-api
$ composer install
```
#### Configure the Environment
Create `.env` file:
```
$ cat .env.example > .env
```
If you want you can edit database name, database username and database password.


#### Migrations
First, we need connect to the database. For homestead user, login using default homestead username and password:

Run the Artisan migrate command:
```
$ php artisan migrate
```
If you want to seed the database with fake data run the following command instead:
```
$ php artisan migrate --seed
```

### Authentication

#### Creating api_key and Login
The api_key is used for granting access to a user. For creating api_key we have to use the `/login` route. Here is an example of creating api_key with [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/).
![api_key_creation](/public/docs/images/register.png?raw=true "api_key creation example")

#### Using the api_key
Some routes are restricted to public use. To use those routes you have to login and send request with the api_key you have should put it in the HTTP "Authorization" header.
![authorization](/public/docs/images/authorization.png?raw=true "authorization example")

### Playing the Game
Tic-tac-toe is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a (usually) 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

![board](/public/docs/images/board.png?raw=true "board example")

#### Join Battle
By using the `/game/join` route you can join any available game. If there isn't any game available to join, API creates one automatically for you. 
The `/game/join` route returns `Game` object as response.
```
{
    "data": {
        "id": 2,
        "start_time": {
            "date": "2017-08-13 17:10:26.748287",
            "timezone_type": 3,
            "timezone": "UTC"
        },
        "pX": 1,
        "pO": 5,
        "size": 3,
        "result": null,

        "updated_at": "2017-08-13 17:10:26"
    },
    "message": "OK"
}
```

| `GAME` status	| Desciption  |
| ----- | ------------- |
| 0		| Finished
| 1    	| Waiting for player
| 2     | Online

#### Place Marker
